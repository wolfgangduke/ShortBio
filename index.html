      <p>After 22 years as a Stockbroker, looking after small to medium retail investors, I've taken this pandemics
        opportunity to re-skill into the creative business arts of Web development. It's all new to me, but I'm excited
        to think I can one day build novel services in an industry that will thrive in this post COVID environment. I
        also look forward to working with talented people whose abilities I can't even comprehend yet.</p>
